# countmaster â€” A RESTful Counting Application

countmaster is a rewrite of [Tally](https://github.com/Mapkin/tally) using
Flask and Redis. We use it to track our usage of 3rd party APIs.

## Installation

### Mac OS

    $ brew install pypy
    $ virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/pypy venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Ignore any errors about C extensions not building. The pure Python packages
are sufficient.

    $ foreman start

If you want to stay all-Python, you can use Honcho instead:

    $ pip install honcho
    $ honcho start
